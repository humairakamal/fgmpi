                      HOW TO USE hashlib
                      ==================
                      
     <http://cbfalconer.home.att.net/download/hashlib.zip>

To use this easily you should also have a copy of hashlib.h
printed out, or easily available in another editor window.  It
describes the complete interface to hashlib, and this is just an
explanation of the functions, why they exist, etc.  hashlib.h
is extensively commented.

What is it for?
==============

You may be wondering "for what is hashlib useful".  The answer
is that it is a storage facility.  You can hand it things, and
it will tuck them away, and make it easy for you to find them
later.

A major point is that the time it takes to store, find, delete,
or retrieve an item is almost constant no matter how big the
table gets.  Also, you don't have to worry about the table size,
because it will automatically adapt itself.  It may hold 5 items
or millions.  The limit is your memory.

What does it do?
===============

For a list of the things it will do, you should have the file
"hashlib.h" handy.  This details all the things you can do, and
how to customize the system to your data.  The interface 
functions are:

  hshinit, hshkill                Make or destroy a hashtable
  hshfind, hshinsert, hshdelete   Insert, find, take out items
  hshwalk                         For advanced usage, later
  hshstatus                       Such things as how many stored

Customizing to your data:
========================

In order to use a table, the first thing you have to do is to
create it with hshinit.  At that time you tell hashlib how to
process your data.  I will return to this later.

Your actual data takes some form, which is entirely up to you.
It must be possible to refer to a complete data item by a
single pointer.  Your data also will have some sort of key, or
even multiple keys.  It can have whatever auxiliary data you
like.  This implies you must define a structure somewhere for
your own benefit:

   typedef struct hashitem {
      sometype   yourkey;
      otherstuff yourdata;
   } item, *itemptr;
   
The field names, structure name, typedef'd names, etc are
entirely up to you.  Somewhere in your program you will have
at least one of these things.  hashlib will make more of them
in which to store copies of the data you insert.

Equality
========

Since hashlib works on all forms of data, it obviously can't
read your data description.  So you have to tell it how to
find out that two data items have the identical key.  This    
introduces the type (defined in hashlib.h):

  typedef int (*hshcmpfn)(void *litem, void *ritem);
  
which is a function you will design and program, and one of
the items you pass in the hshinit call is a pointer to that
function.  Let us assume that in the item definition above
sometype is int (such as the typedef below under copying).
Then your comparison function could be:

   int mycmp(void *litem, void *ritem)
   {
      itemptr left  = litem;
      itemptr right = ritem;
      int     lvalue, rvalue;
      
      lvalue = left->yourkey;
      rvalue = right->yourkey;
      return lvalue == rvalue;
   }
   
NOTE: I have made this function more complex than it need
be, in order to emphasize how it goes about it.
   
The left and right pointers come from hashlib, and hashlib
doesn't know about your data type.  Therefore it converts them
into the C universal pointer, a "void *".  When you get them
back you have to convert them back into itemptr, so you can
access the fields of your data.

All hashlib cares about is "are they equal", so the above
returns only 0 or 1, for notequal and equal.  The comparison
routine will be useful for other things if you make it return
-1, 0, or +1 for less, equal, greater.  To do this you could
make the return statement say:

     return (lvalue > rvalue) - (lvalue < rvalue);
     
which will turn out to be 1-0, 0-0, 0-1 for the three cases.
The point is not to return (lvalue - rvalue), because this
can run into overflow and give erroneous results.

For string comparisons you can just call strcmp with the 
appropriate parameters.

Copying
=======

When you pass an item to hashlib you don't want to worry about
who owns the space it takes.  Therefore the principle is
"hashlib owns all the items it stores".  Thus hashlib makes a
copy of any data item it inserts into the table.  Once more,
only you know how to do this, and you have to tell hashlib.

  typedef void *(*hshdupfn)(void *item);

in hashlib.h specifies what this function must look like.  For
the simple structure above, all it would have to do is malloc
space for a copy, and copy the fields.  It must copy at least
the key field, the rest is up to you.  Remember it is dealing
with pointer to data, and the first thing you have to do is
make the item pointer into a pointer to your structure.

Lets make the simple data structure above more concrete:

   typedef struct hashitem {
      int   yourkey;
      int   yourdata;
   } item, *itemptr;

Then the hshdupefn (notice how the function is defined by
editing the typedef for hshdupfn) could be:

    void *mydupe(void *item)
    {
       itemptr myitem = item;
       itemptr newitem;
       
       if (newitem = malloc(sizeof *newitem) {
          newitem.yourkey = myitem.yourkey;
          newitem.yourdata = myitem.yourdata;
          /* or "*newitem = *myitem" in this case */
       }
       return newitem;
    }
    
Notice again that only your code knows what is in the items to
be stored, and thus how to copy them.  Your item can be as
complicated as you wish.  So lets make it store strings:

   typedef struct hashitem {
      char *yourkey;
      int   yourdata;
   } item, *itemptr;

and see how it affects the hshdupefn.  Yourkey is now just a
pointer to a string somewhere, which may want to be modified
or used in some manner.  So we have do what is called a deep
copy.

    void *mydupe(void *item)
    {
       itemptr myitem = item;
       itemptr newitem;
       
       if (newitem = malloc(sizeof *newitem) {
          if (newitem->yourkey = 
                   malloc(1+strlen(myitem->yourkey) {
             strcpy(newitem->yourkey, myitem->yourkey;
             newitem.yourdata = myitem.yourdata;
          }
          else {  /* we ran out of memory, release and fail */
             free(newitem)
             newitem = NULL
          }
       }
       return newitem;
    }

Notice how it returns NULL if malloc fails to secure the
necessary memory anywhere.  This allows hashlib to do the
right things under nasty cases, such as exhausting memory.

The need for a deep copy is generally signalled by having 
pointers in your data type description.  All those pointers have
to be resolved to data that can belong to the hash table.


Letting Go
==========

Once you have thrown a whole mess of data at hashlib, and it is
keeping track, you may decide to release it all.  While you
could often just abandon it, and let the operating system clean
up after you when your program ends, this is not a good
practice.  Besides, your program may not end.  So you have to
tell hashlib how to get rid of one item, which it will use to
get rid of all of them when you use the hshkill function
(described later).

   typedef void (*hshfreefn)(void *item);
   
in hashlib.h describes that function.  Now we will assume the
complex hshdupefn last described above, and the corresponding
type definition for an item.  Again, we build the function 
header by editing the typedef and converting the passed void*
pointer:

   void myundupe(void *item)
   {
      itemptr myitem = item;
      
      free(myitem->yourkey);  /* First, because this won't */
      free(myitem);           /* exist after this one. */
   }

thus returning all the allocated memory.  Notice how it undoes
everything that mydupe did.  The mydupe/myundupe pair could even
open and close files, but you will rarely want to handle
thousands of open files at once.

Now we can use the hshkill function to undo hshinit.


Hashing
=======

This is fundamental to the efficient operation of a hashtable,
although hashlib can put up with pretty rotten hashing and still
grind out answers (but it may take a long time).  What we need
to do is calculate a single unsigned long value from the key.
What these functions are is basically black magic, therefore
hashlib contains a couple of utility functions usable for 
hashing strings.  There are also examples of hashing integers
in the hashtest.c program along with some references to the
subject of creating hash functions.  For now we will just use
the utility string hashing functions provided in hashlib, i.e.
hshstrhash(char *) and hshstrehash(char *).

Because of the efficient way hashlib handles overflows (it
basically just corrects them) it is necessary to have two
hash functions.  For the above item type with strings, they
would be:

  typedef unsigned long (*hshfn)(void *item);
  
for reference, which we edit again and get:  

  unsigned long myhash(void *item)
  {
     itemptr myitem = item;  /* getting used to this? */
     return hshstrhash(myitem->yourkey);
  }

and we need two such functions, so:

  unsigned long myrehash(void *item)
  {
     itemptr myitem = item;  /* getting used to this? */
     return hshstrehash(myitem->yourkey);
  }
  
which basically differ only in  their names and in the
convenience hash function they call.

Now we have finally customized the system to our own data
format.  We will tell hashlib about these functions when
we create a hashtable with hshinit.

Using hashlib
=============

First, we need some way to refer to the table.  So we must 
have a data item of type hshtbl* to hold it.  We will initialize
that by calling hshinit.  This is much like opening a file.  For
convenience here is the prototype for hshinit again:

/* initialize and return a pointer to the data base */
hshtbl *hshinit(hshfn hash, hshfn rehash,
                hshcmpfn cmp,
                hshdupfn dupe, hshfreefn undupe,
                int      hdebug);

Now this following is a fragment from your code:

hshtbl *mytable;

/* initialize and return a pointer to the data base */
mytable = hshinit(myhash, myrehash,
                  mycmp,
                  mydupe, myundupe,
                  0);

which tells hashlib all about the customizing functions you have
created.  Note that all those functions can be static, unless
you have other uses for them outside your source file.  You can
use those functions yourself as you please.

Don't forget the final 0 in the call to hshinit.  That parameter
provides for future extensions and debugging abilities, and 
passing a zero here will maintain compatibility.

You can create more than one hash table if you desire.  If they
handle the same data format you can just do exactly the same
call as above, except you will need a new variable of type
hshtbl* to hold the table identification.  If they don't hold
the same data type you can supply different functions to 
hshinit.  It is up to you.

hshtbl *mysecondtable;

mysecondtable = hshinit(....); /* as before */

These tables will live until you exterminate them.  Meanwhile
you can store, find, delete, etc. items from the table.  You
destroy the table by calling hshkill with the pointer that
hshinit returned.

    hshkill(mytable);  /* all gone */
    
but until that is done, lets use the functions.

NOTE: Some systems have a free that takes time proportional to
the number of items allocated.  When hashlib has stored a large
number of item freeing them via hshkill will take n * n time,
which may get exorbitantly long.  The fault is that of the
system free() function.  The work-around is to just exit your
program, without calling hshkill, and let the system do the
cleanup.  This will usually work.

Inserting (storing) data:
=========================

From here on I am assuming you have opened the hash table with
mytable = hshinit(...), and that you have defined your data
with:

   typedef struct hashitem {
      char *yourkey;
      int   yourdata;
   } item, *itemptr;

Surprise, you store data by calling hshinsert.  Here is the
prototype, for reference:

void * hshinsert(hshtbl *master, void *item);

and you call it with a pointer to the table in which to insert
the item, and a pointer to the item to insert.

You may have a variable of type item (after all, you know what
it is, even if hashlib does not).  So the critical items are:

hshtable *mytable;
item      myitem;
item     *something;

(NOTE: the "item *something" could equally well be:
           "itemptr something")

You will put the data you want into myitem, filling its fields
as needed.  Then you call:

   something = hshinsert(mytable, &myitem);
   
If, after this, 'something' is NULL, the insertion failed 
(probably because you ran out of memory).  Otherwise 'something'
points to the piece of memory owned by hashlib which stores a
copy of myitem.  You can use something to modify the stored
copy, but you MUST NOT do anything that would change the value
of the key, and thus change what a hshfn such as myhash or 
myrehash returns when passed that item.  NEVER EVER do that.

NOTE: The code that does the copying from myitem into hashlibs
memory is whatever you put in the hshdupe function.

One thing you might want to do is have a field in an item that
holds a count.  You could have the dupe function zero this
field, so that you know how it is initialized.  Then, when
hshinsert returns an itemptr you can use that to increment that
field with a statement like "something->count++;".  That way you
can keep track of how many times a given key has been inserted.

NOTE: If hshinsert finds an item already stored, it simply
returns a pointer to that storage.  It does not use the dupe
function to make another copy.

Finding a data item by the key:
==============================

Again we have the same variables as above for insertion.  We
simply call:

   something = hshfind(mytable, &item);
   
and if 'something' is NULL the item is not present, otherwise
it is a pointer to the memory holding it.  The same cautions
as for hshinsert hold, i.e. you MUST NOT do anything that
affects the key and thus the hash functions.  Being present
means only that 'something' and &item have identical keys, as
defined by mycmp() function.

Deleting stored items:
=====================

Again, we have the same variables.  Surprise, the calling format
is the same:

   something = hshdelete(mytable, &item);
   
but now there is a significant difference.  The hash table no
longer owns the memory that stored that item, you do.  So you
have to do something with it, assuming it isn't NULL (meaning
that the value in item was never stored in the table).  What 
you do is up to you, but sooner or later you should release
it by:
           myundupe(something);
           
which you designed specifically for this purpose.

Example programs:
================

The hashlib package contains two example programs - wdfreq.c and
markov.c.  markov is a complex application, and can best be
understood by reading "The Practice of Programming", by
Kernighan and Pike.  There are heavy similarities.  wdfreq.c is
fairly simple, and also illustrates the use of hshstatus() and
hshwalk() functions, which are discussed below. Another useful
illustrative program is id2id-20, which maintains two tables of
identifier strings in identical format databases. It can be
found at:

   <http://cbfalconer.home.att.net/download/id2id-20.zip>

OTHER ABILITIES
===============

This section adds information about walking the entire contents
of the table, and performing operations on each stored item.
There are illustrations of these operations in the demonstration
applications (markov and wdfreq) in the hashlib package.

Status of the hash table:
========================

hashlib.h defines the following structure:

typedef struct hshstats {
   unsigned long probes, misses,  /* usage statistics */
                 hentries,        /* current entries count */
                 hdeleted;        /* deleted entry count */
   enum hsherr   herror;          /* error status */
   unsigned int  version;         /* hashlib version */
} hshstats;

and also provides the function:

hshstats hshstatus(hshtbl *master);

This allows you to access information on the current state of
the hash table.  hentries and hdeleted tell you how many of each
are present.  (deleted items still take up some room in the
table until the table is automatically reorganized by growing)

The values of probes and misses allows you to evaluate how good
your hash functions are on your particular data.  probes tells
you how many times a key was searched.  If the hash function
was ideal misses would be zero, but in practice the system has
to make additional tries, and this measures those.  You should
normally find that the ratio of misses to probes runs around 
1.5 or so.  If it gets above 3 redesign your hash functions.

By the way, probes is an internal number, and will normally be 
higher than the actual number of calls you have made to insert,
find, or delete items.

hashlib.h also defines the following possible values for the
field herror:

/* Possible error returns, powers of 2 */
enum hsherr {hshOK = 0, hshNOMEM, hshTBLFULL, hshINTERR = 4};

Normally this field will be zero, but if a failure occurs you
can investigate it by looking at this field.  hshTBLFULL will
only occur when you attempt to store very many items, meaning
over about 2,000,000.  This is controlled in the hashlib.c
source code.  hshNOMEM occurs when your system runs out of 
memory.  hshINTERR means I did something wrong, and you should
save something that triggers it and let me know.  Since I never
make mistakes, you must have a hardware fault!

Scanning the whole table:
========================

Sometimes you want to examine all the data saved.  You may want
to sum a data field, print them all out, sort them, or something
else. This is where the hshwalk function, described in
hashlib.h, comes in:

  int hshwalk(hshtbl *master, hshexecfn exec, void *datum);

which allows you to call a function you write, which knows the
format of the data, for every item stored in the table.  The
function must be of type hshexecfn, also described in hashtbl.h.

typedef int (*hshexecfn)(void *item, void *datum, void *xtra);

xtra will normally be supplied as NULL, but allows for various
specialized debugging operations.  datum is simply echoing back
the value of datum you gave to hshwalk, and allows you to
specify memory fields that are available to every call to the
hshexecfn.  This is similar to global memory, but does not 
interfere with the reentrancy of the hashlib code.

item will be a pointer to the actual item stored.

If your function returns anything other than zero, the walk
will be stopped, and that value returned from hshwalk.

Let us assume you are storing things of this form:

   typedef struct hashitem {
      char *yourkey;
      int   yourdata;
   } item, *itemptr;

and you have been setting the field yourdata when inserting the
items.  Now you want to scan them all and find out which has
the largest value of yourdata.

We will have to design something that can keep track of which is
largest between function calls.  Something like:

   typedef struct keeptrack {
      itemptr   biggest;
      int       bigvalue;
   } keeptrack;
   
Now we create a thing to hold that information:

   keeptrack  xtradata;
   
and initialize it with:

   xtradata.biggest = NULL;
   xtradata.bigvalue = -INT_MIN;
   
Now lets temporarily jump to the hshexecfn we must design to do
the real work.  It will need access to that xtradata thing,
which it will receive through the datum parameter.  It will not
use the xtra parameter.

int execfn(void *item, void *datum, void *xtra)
{
   keeptrack xdata = datum;  /* same conversion of void* */
   itemptr   xitem = item;   /* and the data storage */
   
   if (xitem->yourdata > xdata->bigvalue) {
      /* found a new largest value - record it */
      xdata->biggest = xitem;
      xdata->bigvalue = xitem->yourdata;
   }
   /* otherwise we can ignore this item */
   return 0;  /* no error occurred */
}

Now lets return to the function that calls hshwalk:

void findbiggest(hshtbl *table)
{
   keeptrack xtradata;

   xtradata.biggest = NULL;
   xtradata.bigvalue = -INT_MIN;
   hshwalk(table, execfn, &xtradata);
   /* which will pass each item stored to execfn */
   /* together with the address of xtradata */
   /* when it finishes xtradata will identify */
   /* the item with the biggest yourdata field */
   
   /* so do something with the content of xtradata */
}

There are examples of this sort of operation in wdfreq.c and in
markov.c, where it is used to gather statistics.

Now go forth and store and manipulate data!
